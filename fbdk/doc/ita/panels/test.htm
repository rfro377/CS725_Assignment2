<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">IEC 61499 Interoperability Test Procedure</H2>
<P>The following general procedure may be used to test the
compliance of independently developed implementations to the <A
	HREF="../s3.htm" TARGET="_parent">interoperability provisions</A> of
the IEC 61499 <A HREF="../index.htm" TARGET="_top">Compliance
Profile</A> for IEC 61499 Feasibility Demonstrations.</P>

<OL>
	<LI>Load a test panel configuration into the <B>FBEditor</B>
	application of the <B>Function Block Development Kit (FBDK)</B>. These
	configurations are located in the <TT>src/ita/</TT> subdirectory of the
	FBDK <A HREF="http://www.holobloc.com/doc/fbdk/index.htm"
		TARGET="_blank">download</A>.
	<LI>Edit the test panel configuration if necessary as follows:
	<UL>
		<LI><A HREF="CODEC_TEST.htm"><TT>CODEC_TEST</TT></A><TT>, </TT><A
			HREF="CODEC_TEST2.htm"><TT>CODEC_TEST2</TT></A> - Since these panels
		test instances of <TT>PUBLISH</TT> and <TT>SUBSCRIBE</TT> types, which
		utilize multicast UDP, they may be used unchanged to test
		corresponding <TT>SUBSCRIBE</TT> and <TT>PUBLISH</TT> instances in
		independent implementations. They may also be edited to test other
		combinations of UDP addresses, socket numbers, data types and service
		interface types by editing the appropriate elements of the
		configuration.
		<LI><A HREF="CS21_TEST.htm"><TT>CS21_TEST</TT></A> - Delete from
		the configuration the device containing the element that is to be
		remotely tested. For instance, if a remote instance of <TT>SERVER_1_2</TT>
		is to be tested, delete the <TT>SRVR</TT> device from the
		configuration. This configuration may also be edited to test other
		combinations of TCP/IP addresses, socket numbers, data types and
		service interface types. <I>NOTE </I>- See also the NOTE to step 4
		below.
	</UL>
	<LI>Launch the test panel configuration using the <B>Run/Launch</B>
	menu item of the FBEditor.
	<LI>Start the independent implementation to be tested. <I>NOTE
	</I>- Steps 3 and 4 must be reversed if an instance of <TT>SERVER</TT> type
	is to be tested in the independent implementation.<I> </I>
	<LI>Test the implementation by triggering data transmission from
	the test panel and observing the effect on the independent
	implementation or vice versa as appropriate.
