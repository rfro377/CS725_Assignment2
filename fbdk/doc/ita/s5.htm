<H2>7. TEST REQUIREMENTS</H2>
<P>No specific test requirements for compliance with this profile
are currently defined. However, a set of <A HREF="./panels/index.htm">test
panels</A> has been developed that may be used for testing the <A
	HREF="s3.htm">interoperability provisions</A> of this Compliance
Profile. The configurations described in the test panel documentation
are executable with the Function Block Development Kit (<A
	HREF="../fbdk/FBEditor.html" TARGET="_blank">FBDK</A>), and are located
in the <TT>/src/ita/</TT> subdirectory of the FBDK <A
	HREF="http://www.holobloc.com/doc/fbdk/index.htm" TARGET="_blank">download</A>.</P>
<P>The subdirectories of the FBDK <TT>src</TT> directory contain a
large number of library elements compliant to the provisions of IEC
61499-2, which can be used for testing the ability of software tools to
comply with the XML import portion of the <A HREF="s2.htm">portability
provisions</A> of this Compliance Profile. Similarly, the <A
	HREF="../fbdk/FBEditor.html" TARGET="_blank">FBEditor</A> application
of the FBDK can also be used to import library elements produced by
other software tools to test their compliance with the XML export
portability requirements.</P>
Many of the examples provided with the
<A HREF="http://www.holobloc.com/doc/fbdk/index.htm" TARGET="_blank">FBDK</A>
can also be used for testing the compliance of remote devices with the
<A HREF="s4.htm">configurability provisions</A>
of this Compliance Profile. Finally,
<A HREF="./config/index.htm">system configurations</A>
are provided in the
<TT>src/ita/</TT>
subdirectory of the FBDK for manual testing of configurability.
