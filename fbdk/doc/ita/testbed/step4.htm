<p>At this point the ring has been transferred to the assembly hopper
by cycling the rotary solenoid from the <b>Index
Cam Open</b> to the <b>Index Cam Closed</b> position and back. The
presence of the ring is indicated by the <b>Hopper
Full</b> detector.</p>
<p>In this picture, a peg has passed the sort station and has been
deflected down the peg chute onto the belt conveyor.
The mechanical arrangement is such that the ring will be assembled to
the peg as the latter is carried under the
assembly station by the belt conveyor.</p>

presence of two rings in the hopper may cause
the assembly operation to jam.</p>
