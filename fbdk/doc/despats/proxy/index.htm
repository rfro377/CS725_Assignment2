<H3><A NAME="Problem"></A>Problem Statement</H3>
<P>The proxy pattern is described as one which &quot;decouples clients
from their servers by creating a local proxy, or stand-in, for the less
accessible server. When the client needs to request a service from the
server, such as retrieving a value, it asks its local proxy. The proxy
can then marshal a request to the original server….&quot;[B.P.Douglass,
<A
	HREF="http://www.aw-bc.com/catalog/academic/product/0,1144,0321160762,00.html">Real-Time
UML</A>]. One use for this pattern in the IEC 61499 context is to
utilize <A HREF="../../fbdk/howtosi.htm">service interface function
blocks</A> (SIFBs) as proxies for functions of devices that may not
themselves be compliant to the standard.</P>
<P>Consider the example shown below, where the operation of two machines
must be coordinated, but the machine interfaces are located on
incompatible sensor/actuator links. In this case, interoperation may be
achieved by using two IEC 61499-compliant devices, each with its own
special-purpose interface to the appropriate sensor/actuator link (or by
a single IEC 61499-compliant device containing two such interfaces). The
devices may then be populated with SIFBs that serve as local proxies for
the actual interfaces located on the sensor/actuator links. Coordinated
machine operations can then be achieved by the addition of appropriate
application function block instances, data and event connections within
each device, plus communication SIFBs to achieve the required event and
data connections between the two devices. Note that communication SIFBs
would not be required if all proxy SIFBs and application FBs could be
co-located within a single resource of a single device.</P>
