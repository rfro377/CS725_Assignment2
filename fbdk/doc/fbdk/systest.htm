<H2 ALIGN="center"><A NAME="Create" />Testing a System
Configuration</H2>
<P>Testing a system configuration consists of three steps:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><A HREF="#Remote">Launching remote devices</A> (if any)</LI>
	<LI><A HREF="#System">Launching the system configuration</A></LI>
	<LI><A HREF="#Testing">Testing and stopping the system</A></LI>
</OL>
<A NAME="Remote"></A>
<H3>Launching Remote Devices</H3>
<P>If any of the devices in the system configuration are <B>remote
devices</B> (<TT><A HREF="../common/RMT_DEV.htm">RMT_DEV</A>, <A
	HREF="../common/RMT_FRAME.htm">RMT_FRAME</A></TT>, etc), these must be
launched before the system configuration so that the FBEditor tool can
configure them as part of the system launch process. How this is done
depends on the location of the device:</P>
<UL>
	<LI>A <B>locally hosted</B> remote device is one whose <TT>MGR_ID</TT>
	parameter value begins with <TT>"localhost:", "127.0.0.1:"</TT>, or the
	IP address of the local workstation, e.g., <TT>"192.168.1.3"</TT> (the
	default initial value for the <TT>MGR_ID</TT> parameter is <TT>"localhost:61499"</TT>).
	This type of device can be launched directly from the FBEditor, using
	the <IMG SRC="Play16.gif"><B>Run</B> option from its pop-up menu
	in the system configuration diagram (<IMG SRC="system.gif"> in
	the navigation tree).</LI>
	<LI>A <B>remotely hosted</B> device is one that does not meet the
	above criteria. This kind of device can be launched in one of two ways:</LI>
	<UL>
		<LI>If the remote device is located on a workstation capable of
		hosting the <A HREF="index.htm" TARGET="_blank">FBDK</A>, the device
		can be launched from the same system configuration on the remote
		workstation by adjusting its <TT>MGR_ID</TT> parameter appropriately.
		For instance, suppose a system configuration is to be launched from
		workstation <B>A</B> with IP address <TT>192.168.1.3</TT>, and the
		configuration contains a remote device <TT>DEV_D</TT> with a <TT>MGR_ID</TT>
		value of <TT>"192.168.1.5:61500"</TT>. Then if there is a workstation
		<B>B</B> with IP address <TT>192.168.1.5</TT> hosting the FBDK, the
		remote device could be launched as follows:</LI>
		<OL>
			<LI>Open the same application in the FBEditor on workstation <B>B</B>.</LI>
			<LI>Set the <TT>DEV_D.MGR_ID</TT> parameter to <TT>"localhost:61500"</TT>
			in the FBEditor on workstation <B>B</B>.</LI>
			<LI>Launch <TT>DEV_D</TT> on workstation <B>B</B>, using the <IMG
				SRC="Play16.gif"><B>Run</B> option from its pop-up menu.</LI>
		</OL>
		<LI>If the remote device is not located on a workstation capable
		of hosting the FBDK (for example, an embedded controller), it must be
		launched using some platform-specific procedure.</LI>

<H3>Launching the System Configuration</H3>
<P>After starting the remote devices, if any, you launch the system
configuration by pressing the <IMG SRC="Play16.gif"> button next
to the <B>Run</B> item on the menu bar. As the configuration proceeds,
you will see the configuration commands and responses flashing by on the
status bar.</P>
<P>If an error occurs, during launching, an error message will
appear in a popup window. If you need to find out exactly where in the
configuration process this error occurred, you can turn on the <B>Log</B>
checkbox in the <B>Run</B> menu, which will cause the configuration
commands and responses to be output to the command prompt window from
which the FBEditor was launched.</P>
<P>Possible error messages include:</P>
<UL>
	<LI>NO_SOCKET - A remote device has either not been launched or
	has failed to initialize its management socket identified by the <TT>MGR_ID</TT>
	parameter. This usually occurs after a delay caused by waiting for the
	socket, which you will notice by a configuration command or response
	being "frozen" in the status bar.</LI>
	<LI>NOT_READY - A device is not responding quickly enough. You may
	be able to overcome this problem by adjusting the command/response
	timeout, using the <B>Timeout...</B> item of the <B>Run</B> menu.</LI>
	<LI>INVALID_STATE - This is probably due to trying to re-configure
	a device that is already running. You will have to kill the running
	device instance and start a new one.</LI>
</UL>
<P>For explanations of other error messages, see <A
	HREF="../ita/s4.htm#4.5" TARGET="_blank">subclause 6.5</A> of the <A
	HREF="../ita/index.htm" TARGET="_blank">Compliance Profile</A>.</P>

<H3>Testing and Stopping the System Configuration</H3>
<P>After testing to validate the system's operation versus
requirements, you can stop the configuration and kill all the locally
running processes by exiting the FBEditor. This assumes, of course, that
you are happy with the results of the testing and have already saved all
your editing work on the system configuration.</P>
<P>In the more usual case that you want to stop the running
processes and make changes to correct errors, you can do the following:</P>
<OL>
	<LI>Stop the processes in non-workstation hosts with appropriate
	platform-specific actions.</LI>
	<LI>Stop the processes running in windows on both the local and
	remote workstations by closing the windows.</LI>
	<LI>Stop the non-window processes in both local and remote
	workstations by clicking on their identifiers in the <IMG
		SRC="terminate.gif"><B>Shut Down</B> item of the <B>Run</B>
	menus.</LI>
</OL>
