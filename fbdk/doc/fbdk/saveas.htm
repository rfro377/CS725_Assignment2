	<LI>This dialog enables you to save the library element in the
	current FBEditor tab in any of the following formats:
	<UL>
		<LI><A NAME="FileSaveAsXML"></A><B>XML</B>: Saves the current
		library element in an IEC 61499 XML encoded file.</LI>
		<LI><A NAME="FileSaveAsJava"></A><B>Java</B>: Saves the current
		library element as a <TT>*.java</TT> file and compiles it to a <TT>*.class</TT>
		file in the same directory. Following compilation, a dialog box will
		open displaying the results of the compilation and the <TT>*.java</TT>
		source file with correspondingly numbered lines.</LI>
		<LI><A NAME="FileSaveAsHTML"></A><B>HTML</B>: Saves the current
		library element as an HTML file containing skeleton documentation for
		the element, including an applet for viewing an XML file containing
		the library element. The size of the applet frame will be the same as
		the current size of the FBEditor frame.</LI>
		<LI><A NAME="FileSaveAsPNG"></A><B>PNG</B>: Saves the contents of
		the Worksheet as a <TT>*.png</TT> file in Portable Network Graphics
		(PNG) format. The size of the PNG image is trimmed to that required to
		display all of the graphic elements in the Worksheet, which may be
		larger or smaller than the size of the Viewport.</LI>
	</UL>
	</LI>
	<LI>The directory in which the files are saved is determined by
	the package name. For instance, if the FBDK is located in the <TT>C:\fbdk</TT>
	directory:
	<UL>
		<LI>the XML file of the element shown above would be stored as <TT>C:\fbdk\src\mach\LOAD_CTL.fbt</TT>;</LI>
		<LI>the HTML file would be stored as <TT>C:\fbdk\src\mach\LOAD_CTL.htm</TT>;</LI>
		<LI>the Java&trade; file would be stored as <TT>C:\fbdk\lib\fb\rt\mach\LOAD_CTL.java</TT>;</LI>
		<LI>the class file would be stored as <TT>C:\fbdk\lib\fb\rt\mach\LOAD_CTL.class</TT>;
		and</LI>
		<LI>the Worksheet contents would be saved as <TT>C:\fbdk\images\fb\rt\mach\LOAD_CTL.png</TT>.</LI>
	</UL>
	</LI>
	<LI>If a file is already saved with the given library element
	name, e.g., <TT>myFBType.java</TT>, it is copied into a backup file,
	e.g., <TT>myFBType.baknn</TT>, where <TT>nn</TT> is the lowest
	available number in the sequence <TT>{00..99}</TT>. <IMG
		SRC="../note.gif">If all the backup numbers in the sequence <TT>00..99</TT>
	are occupied, no backup will be made, so it is a good idea to <B>purge
	backed up files</B> from time to time.</LI>
