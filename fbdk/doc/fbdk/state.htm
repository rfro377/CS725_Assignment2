<H2 ALIGN="center">Editing EC States</H2>
<H3>Adding a State to an ECC</H3>
<P>You can add a state to an ECC by using the <B>New Action</B> item
of the ECC workspace's popup menu (the menu that you get by clicking the
right mouse button on an empty area of the workspace).</P>
<H3>Deleting a State</H3>
<P>You can delete a state from an ECC by using the <B>Delete</B>
option of its popup menu or by using the <B>Alt+Del</B> keychord. Since
this will also delete all transitions to or from the state, a dialog box
will pop up to give you a chance to cancel this action.</P>
<H3>The EC State Dialog</H3>
<P>You can use this dialog both for adding a new state to an ECC or
for editing an existing state. You invoke it by clicking the "Add State"
popup menu item of an ECC, or by double-clicking an existing EC state or
clicking the "Edit" item of its popup menu..</P>
<P ALIGN="center"><IMG SRC="state.gif" ALIGN="bottom" BORDER="0"
	ALT=""></P>
<P>You can close the dialog without making any changes to the state
by pressing the "Cancel" button or the <IMG SRC="close.png"
	ALIGN="middle" ALT=""> in the upper right corner of the dialog.
If you press the "OK" button, and no errors are detected, the requested
changes (if any) will be made and the dialog will close. If an error is
detected when you press the "OK" button, the dialog does not close and
an error message appears at the top line of the dialog, for instance:<A
	NAME="errors"></A></P>
<P ALIGN="center"><IMG SRC="state3.gif" ALIGN="middle" BORDER="0"
	ALT=""> or <IMG SRC="state4.gif" ALIGN="middle" BORDER="0" ALT=""></P>

<H3>Making a State the Initial State</H3>
<P>You can make a state the initial state of the ECC by:</P>
<UL>
	<LI>selecting the state in the ECC;</LI>
	<LI>pressing the <IMG SRC="Up16.gif"><B>Up</B> button;</LI>
	<LI>repeating the above two steps until the state becomes the
	first in the list of EC states and its outline changes to a double line
	to indicate that it is the initial state.</LI>
</UL>
