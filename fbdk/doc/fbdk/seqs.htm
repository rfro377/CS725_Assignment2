<P>A <A HREF="howtosi.htm">service interface function block type</A>
(SIFB type) is characterized by its <I>service specification</I>, which
may consist of a number of <I>service transactions</I>. Each service
transaction consists of zero or one <I>input primitive</I> represented
by an arrow coming into one of the two interfaces of the service,
followed by zero or more <I>output primitives</I>.</P>
<OL>
	<LI>You can change the name of the left or right service interface
	from the <B>Edit</B> item of the service's popup menu in the navigation
	tree. The figure below shows the result of replacing <TT>RESOURCE</TT>
	with <TT>DEVICE</TT> in the <A HREF="howtosi.htm">SIFB template</A>.<BR>

	</LI>
	<LI>You can <B>add a sequence</B> to the service with the <B>New</B>
	item of the service's popup menu in the navigation tree. This opens a <A
		HREF="namecomment.htm">dialog</A> that lets you edit the new
	sequence's name and comment.<IMG SRC="../note.gif">You can reopen
	this dialog whenever the sequence is displayed in the <B>Worksheet</B>
	by double-clicking on the sequence name or using the <B>Edit</B> item
	of its popup menu.</LI>
	<LI>You can <B>remove a sequence</B> when it is displayed in the <B>Worksheet</B>
	by using the <B>Alt+Del</B> keychord on its name or the <B>Delete</B>
	item of its popup menu.</LI>
	<LI>You can <B>move a sequence up or down</B> by selecting it in
	the navigation tree, then using the <B>Move Up/Down</B> <IMG
		SRC="updown.png"> buttons in the menu bar.</LI>
	<LI>You can <B>add a transaction to a sequence</B> from the <B>New</B>
	menu item of the sequence's name when it is displayed in the <B>Worksheet</B>.
	This pops up a dialog as shown below that lets you edit the interface,
	name and parameters of the transaction's initial input primitive.<BR>
	<CENTER><IMG SRC="addtran.png"></CENTER>
	</LI>
	<LI>You can <B>move a transaction up or down in a sequence</B> by
	selecting its input primitive, then using the <B>Move Up/Down</B> <IMG
		SRC="updown.png"> buttons in the menu bar.<IMG SRC="../note.gif"
		HEIGHT="24" WIDTH="32">Even if a transaction doesn't have an
	actual input primitive, you can use a "dummy" input primitive for this
	purpose and delete it when you're done editing the sequence.</LI>
	<LI>You can <B>remove a transaction from a sequence</B> by
	deleting all its primitives (see below).</LI>
	<LI>You can <B>add a primitive to a transaction</B> by using the <B>New</B>
	item of the popup menu of any primitive in the transaction.</LI>
	<LI>You can <B>move an output primitive up or down</B> in a
	transaction with the <B>Move Up/Down</B> <IMG SRC="updown.png">
	buttons in the menu bar. <IMG SRC="../note.gif" HEIGHT="24" WIDTH="32">An
	<B>input primitive</B> if present is always the first one in a
	transaction, so it can't be moved up or down within the transaction.
	That's why you can use it as a "handle" to move the whole transaction
	up or down in the sequence.</LI>
	<LI>You can <B>edit a primitive</B> by double-clicking on its name
	or using the <B>Edit</B> item of its popup menu.</LI>
	<LI>You can <B>delete a primitive</B> from its popup menu or by
	using the <B>Alt+Del</B> keychord.</LI>
