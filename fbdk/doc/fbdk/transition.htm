<H2 ALIGN="center">Editing EC Transitions</H2>
<H3>Adding a Transition to an ECC</H3>
<P>You can add a transition between any two states of an ECC using <A
	HREF="dndconn.htm">drag-and-drop editing</A> in the same manner as
connections in a function block diagram (FBD). The initial transition
condition is unconditional ("1"), which may lead to a <A HREF="#Self">self-cycle</A>
or a <A HREF="#Guard-Only">guard-only cycle</A>, so an <A HREF="#Dialog">EC
Transition Dialog</A> is opened to check for this possibility and correct
the transition condition if necessary as ilustrated below.</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="dlgtran0.gif" ALT=""></CENTER>
<H3>Deleting a Transition</H3>
<P>You can delete a transition by using the <B>Delete</B> item of
its popup menu or by using the <B>Alt+Del</B> keychord.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Dialog">The EC Transition Dialog</A></H3>
<P>For editing an existing transition, you invoke this dialog by
double-clicking an existing EC transition or clicking the <B>Edit</B>
item of its popup menu. The dialog contains a drop-down list for
selecting the event (if any) in the transition condition. An editable
drop-down list lets you select a Boolean variable as a guard condition,
or to type in a Boolean expression in the IEC 61131-3 ST (Structured
Text) language as the guard condition (if any).<BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN="center"><IMG SRC="dlgtran.gif" ALT=""><BR>
</P>
<P>You can close the dialog without making any changes to the action
by pressing the <B>Cancel </B>button or the <IMG SRC="close.png"
	ALIGN="middle" ALT=""> in the upper right corner of the dialog.
If you press the <B>OK </B>button, the requested changes (if any) will
be made and the dialog will close.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="../note.gif" ALT="">The FBEditor does not detect
whether the guard condition is a proper Boolean expression; this will
only be caught by the compiler when the <IMG SRC="SaveAs16.gif" ALT=""><A
	HREF="saveas.htm">SaveAs... =&gt;Java</A> option is exercised.</P>
<H3>Empty Transitions</H3>
<P>If both the Event and Guard Condition fields are empty when you
press the <B>OK </B>button, an error message will be displayed and the
dialog will not close.</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="dlgtran2.gif" ALT=""></CENTER>
<H3><A NAME="Self">Self-Cycles</A></H3>
<P>A <I>self-cycle</I> exists when there is a transition from an EC
action back to itself. If there is no event associated with such a
transition, there is a possibility that the process that is executing
the ECC may enter an infinite loop (or, in the case of the FBRT runtime
provided with the FBDK, cause a stack overflow).</P>
<P>Consider the following example, using the <TT>test/TEST_GUARDS.fbt</TT>
file as a basis:</P>

<H3><A NAME="Guard-Only">Guard-Only Cycles</A></H3>
<P>A <I>guard-only cycle</I> is the general case of a <A
	HREF="#Self">self-cycle</A>, where a path exists from an EC start,
through other EC states and back to itself through a path consisting of
transitions with guard-only conditions (i.e., transitions not containing
an event). This also poses the possibility that the process that is
executing the ECC may enter an infinite loop or cause a stack overflow
in the FBRT.</P>
<P>For instance, if an unconditional transition is attempted from
the <TT>START</TT> to the <TT>ADD1</TT> state in the <TT>TEST_GUARDS</TT>
example above, the following diagnostic message results:</P>
